## Kinesis - Non-realtime functionalities

Originally *Kinesis* is a interactive installation based on the KINECT.
This Branch is an addition to the system with WIP explorations of non-realtime functionalities that could augment the interactive experience or result in an animated video based on the existing system.

For the interactive System check the other branch [**here**](https://github.com/TimSBB/Kinesis).

A [**project Diary**](https://github.com/timrumpf/Kinesis/blob/video/documentation/project_diary.md) can be found here.
